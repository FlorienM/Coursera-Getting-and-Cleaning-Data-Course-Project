# Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project

### Content
* `run_analysis.R` - processes the original data set and outputs tidy data sets;
* `CodeBook.md` - describes the variables, the data, and the transformations.

### Project
The purpose of this Course Project is to clean up The Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set and create a new tidy dataset, using an R script.

The Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set was cleaned in the `run_analysis.R` script, resulting in a new tidy dataset called `TidyData.txt`.   

The `CodeBook.md` file describes the variables, the data, and the transformations performed to clean up the data.
